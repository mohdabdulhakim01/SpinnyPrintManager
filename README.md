# SpinnyPrintManager
Simple print service manager for Student Printing Business
This system is made by myself when I start my small for fun printing business when I'm still at the hostel to help other to print their work.
This system split with two mode which is regular printing which can print batch of document and also included duplex mode which support cheap printer that do not support duplex mode.
The second mode is poster maker which able to split image to 2x2 or 4x4 picture to make large poster when combined together after printed.

# Note
This program is quite old and not intended to be succesfully build and run on different computer. I only develop and run it on my own computer which i already installed the required software and custom setting based on my possible use. But you can modify it yourself and build it your own to make sure it work.

The Ui is basic and some part may be bad and sometime the app seem unstable since the progrm running 3rd party app behind the scene and have some waiting animation 
which make myself keep asking "is this program running or not ?". But mostly like 90% of the time it is working quite well ðŸ˜‚.
